# React Server Components from Scratch

[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/F83wMYl9GWM)

This video applies things Dan Abramov taught in [his GitHub discussion](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/5).

Please note that this is a streamlined, barebones model that takes a significant number of shortcuts and isn't fully representative of the complete, in-depth implementation. It's designed to give you a working knowledge of React and Next.js, allowing you to comprehend the operations occurring behind the scenes. This should teach you how server components _works_, not how to use server components.

## How to Use

This repo has 2 branches:

- `main` for the starting point, and
- `spoild` for the finishing one.

Feel free to browse them as necessary. You can also clone the repo and run `git checkout <branch>` to switch between them.
